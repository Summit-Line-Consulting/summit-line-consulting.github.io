## *About Angie*

I am passionate about helping organizations unravel and shape their unique financial narratives. By demystifying financial drivers, distilling risks and opportunities, and enhancing financial agility through thoughtful planning and reporting, I have successfully driven revenue enhancements, cost-saving initiatives, and process optimizations that directly impacted organizations’ ability to achieve their core mission.

However, success in this space isn’t merely about numbers -- it's about fostering a culture of financial fluency and empowerment at all levels of an organization. I am committed to instilling this ethos, equipping teams with the knowledge and tools to make informed financial choices that facilitate quicker execution of strategic priorities and support long-term success.

I am excited to partner with you to co-create possibilities. Let's connect and explore how I can help your organization meet its unique financial challenges and goals. Together, we can forge a path toward financial empowerment and position your organization for a thriving future.
